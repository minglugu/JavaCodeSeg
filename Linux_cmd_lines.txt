CLI -option

可以用tab键 补全CLI

The most popular Linux CLI used at work.

1. 	ls: 		List the directory (folder) system. blue is folder and white is file
	ls [path]
	ls /: 	root directory
	ls -l = ll
	
2. 	pwd: current Working directory. (Shows absolute path)
	(e.g. /root) 
	In Linux, absolute path begins with "/".  

3. 	cd [pathname]	change directory (folder) in the file system.
	pathname can be absolute or relative path
	
	cd /
	cd /root
	
	.. 当前路径的上级路径

	cd .. :	Move one level up (one folder) in the file system.

	cd ./root/  ==  cd root		return to home directory

4.	ctrl + c: cancel

5.	ctrl + insert: copy

6.	shift + insert: paste
	
	setup of shortcuts in Tools menu

7.	touch [option]... file:		make a new empty file
	
	cat:	[option][file]:		show content of a file

	echo:	print out content in terminal or write into a file


8.	ctrl + l: clear the terminal 

9. 	mkdir	Creates a new directory.
	rm		remove


	In terminal, type "yum install tree". yum is a package manager, like an App store.

	tree 	show the structure of directory
	
	E.G.: 
	[root@VM-12-6-centos ~]# tree
	.
	|-- java102
	|   |-- ccc
	|   `-- ddd
	|-- java102.txt
	`-- javaFile
    		|-- a
    		|   |-- 111
    		|   |-- 222
    		|   `-- 333
    		|-- b
    		|   |-- 444
    		|   `-- 555
    		|-- c
    		`-- d
	
	rm: it can delete files and directories. 
	- delete a file
	E.G.: 	[root@VM-12-6-centos ~]# rm test.txt
			rm: remove regular empty file ‘test.txt’? y

	- delete a directory: -r means recursively delete files, because a directory can have files and sub-directories 
	E.G.:	[root@VM-12-6-centos javaFile]# rm -r d
			rm: remove directory ‘d’? y

			[root@VM-12-6-centos javaFile]# rm -rf ccc/
			

			delete all the files, including system files. Very dangerous CMD line
			rm -rf / 
			
			the following CLI can also lead to the above CLI result:
			1. 	rm -rf / tmp/abc.txt
			  	rm will delete two directories:	/ and ./tmp/abc.txt
		
			2.	Linux shell script:
				DIR=abc.txt
				... ... other code
				rm -rf /${DIR} 	万一执行到这个代码的时候，DIR因为一些原因，没有被定义。那么此处不会报错，而是把DIR是为空字符串
								仍然会生成 rm -rf / 这样的命令！！
